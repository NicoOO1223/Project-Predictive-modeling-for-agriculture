# 🌱 Soil Crop Prediction

This project explores how **soil nutrient measurements** (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, pH) can be used to predict crop type using **logistic regression**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- Dataset: `soil_measures.csv` (soil properties for various crops)
- Goal: Identify which single soil feature is most predictive of crop type
- Approach:
  1. Load and examine the dataset
  2. Split data into features (X) and target (y)
  3. Train **logistic regression** models on each feature individually
  4. Evaluate models using **balanced accuracy score**
  5. Identify the best predictive soil feature
